    <td width="382"><p><em><strong>Ademar</strong></em> was an  11 year old boy with the diagnosis of epilepsy  when I met him in January, 2005. His story is tragic in that his mother  developed &lsquo;eclampsia&rsquo; (severe hypertension and seizures) during pregnancy, and  died from a stroke shortly after Ademar&rsquo;s birth. Because of his mother&rsquo;s  condition, Ademar&rsquo;s birth was problematic and his brain likely suffered from a  lack of oxygen during his prolonged delivery, resulting in seizures that began  in infancy.&nbsp; He is under the care of his  very loving grandmother.<br />
        <br /> 
        When I met Ademar, he was having seizures  almost every day. Arrangements were made for evaluation by a neurologist.. He  was started on anti-seizure medications, after which his seizures have been  almost completely eliminated.<br />
        <br />
        Ademar is considered to be a quiet, passive  boy amongst strangers.&nbsp; However, among  his family, he is thought of as obedient, helpful and always fun to be with. My  interview with the 
    grandmother was difficult  to complete due to her constant weeping&hellip; she would like for me to express her sincere gratitude to you, the donors.&nbsp; She says that you have &ldquo;made life so much  better for Ademar&rdquo;. </p>
      <p><strong>RVF Contribution</strong>:&nbsp; 100%  of initial evaluation ($50).&nbsp;  Thereafter, 50-75% of all costs for daily anti-seizure medications  (~$5/wk.) &amp; evaluation by neurologist/lab work every 4-6 months ($8 per  visit)</p>
    <p><strong>Family Contribution</strong>:&nbsp; 25-50%  of all costs depending on ability</p></td>
