    <td width="509"><p><strong><em> Edith</em></strong> is an 8  year old girl with the diagnosis of <strong>epilepsy </strong>(seizure disorder).&nbsp; She is also the younger sister of Rosa Vera  Marino, for whom the fund is named.&nbsp; In  the spring of 2005, shortly after The Rosa Vera Fund had its official  beginning, Edith began to have a type of seizure in which she would suddenly  drop stiffly to the ground. At first this happened every couple of months, but  eventually was occurring weekly, then daily, and she was unable to even attend  school.<br />
        <br />
        Arrangements were made for Edith to be  evaluated by a neurologist ($3). Diagnostic studies ($25) confirmed that she  does in fact have epilepsy. Anti-seizure medications ($1.30/wk) were initiated  with frequent follow-up with the neurologist. Now without a single seizure  episode in the past year, Edith is being weaned from her medication.<br />
        <br />
        One of the most remarkable aspects of this  intervention is that the parents sought us out, despite the unfortunate outcome of her sister&rsquo;s  surgery.&nbsp; From our perspective, it was a  particular pleasure to enroll Edith in the RVF.</p>
