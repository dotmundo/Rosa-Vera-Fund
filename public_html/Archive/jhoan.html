    <td width="329"><p><strong><em>Jhoan</em></strong> is a 5  year old boy who suffered severe brain injury secondary to a traumatic  delivery. He has the incurable diagnosis of cerebral palsy with mental  retardation. Despite the emotional/physical challenges and scarce family  resources that Jhoan requires, his parents adore him and struggle to  care for him in the most dignified manner possible.<br />
        <br /> 
        When I met Jhoan in May, 2005, he was severely malnourished. Even on his best days, feeding Jhoan was problematic due to  the difficulty he has swallowing. He had recently developed a prolonged  gastroenteritis and maintaining his nutrition had become impossible for the  family. He was rapidly losing critical weight and it was apparent that he  wouldn&rsquo;t survive without a major intervention.<br />
        <br /> 
        Utilizing the professional services of an  inpatient renourishment program located an hour from Montero, the RVF made  possible a three month inpatient stay in the San Carlos Refeeding Centre.  Jhoan&rsquo;s mother visited the Centre weekly to learn how to prepare nutritious,  protein-rich yet affordable meals for Jhoan. This skill of course benefits not  only Jhoan, but the entire family.</p>
