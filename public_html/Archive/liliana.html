    <td width="351"><p><strong><em>Liliana</em></strong> has  permanent cochlear damage secondary to chronic, untreated ear infections.&nbsp; The cochlea are sensitive structures in  the inner ear that are integral to our ability to interpret sound.&nbsp; Therefore, Liliana has what is referred to  as &lsquo;acquired deafness&rsquo;.<br />
        <br /> 
        When I met Liliana at age eleven in May,  2005, she was indeed attending school. &nbsp;However, as she could no longer hear and hadn&rsquo;t been taught sign  language, the actual value of her education was of course very limited. Her  pleasant, cooperative demeanor allowed her to simply pass through classes --  without the specialized language instruction and interaction that she  requires.<br />
        <br /> 
        The RVF is assisting Liliana to now attend  the &lsquo;Santa Lucia School for Special Education&rsquo;.&nbsp; She is adored by her instructors, is enthusiastically learning  and communicating with formal sign language skills, and is sharing in  friendships for the first time in years.</p>
