    <td width="325"><p><strong><em>Reina</em></strong> was an 11 year old girl when I met her in April  2003.&nbsp; She had suffered a nearly fatal  case of rheumatic fever, spending over 3 months in the intensive care unit for  complications of kidney and heart failure. Reina had been left by her family in  the hospital alone, and during her entire stay, she was never visited by a  single family member--signifying abandonment.&nbsp;  When it finally came time for discharge, to the dismay of the care team,  Reina left the hospital alone.&nbsp; A social  worker, whom I accompanied, later sought and found Reina living in squalor with  her deaf and blind mother.&nbsp; She had only  4 days of the medications required for her survival remaining.</p>
      <p><u><strong>Intervention</strong></u> <br />
        Reina was one of the  first beneficiaries that received support from the original funds that had been  raised for Rosa Vera.&nbsp; The RVF has and  continues to provide the following services to Reina:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;All  medications and preventive care</li>
        <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Specialist follow-up with nephrology <br />
        and cardiology</li>
        <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;All other routine medical and dental care</li>
      </ol>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>    </td>
  </tr>

    <td height="179" colspan="2"><p>In addition, the RVF is investing in Reina&rsquo;s future by paying for:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>&nbsp; clothing and school uniforms</li>
        <li>&nbsp; school books and supplies</li>
        <li>&nbsp; full participation in&nbsp; a care center for children who have parents  that are unable to care for them.&nbsp; In  this center, she receives 3 meals a day and further education/ skills  training.&nbsp; In return, Reina works as a  teacher&rsquo;s aide tutoring the younger children at the care center.</li>
