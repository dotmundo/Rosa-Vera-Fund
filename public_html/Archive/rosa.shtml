        <p align="justify"><span class="txt_body style1">Rosa Vera Marino was born at 
          her home in Montero, Bolivia, with a serious congenital heart malformation 
          called &#8220;Tetrology of Fallot.&#8221; As a daughter of a traditional, 
          Quechua-speaking family with virtually no education or financial resources, 
          Rosa didn&#8217;t receive the routine surgery that has corrected the 
          malformation in countless other children. When I met Rosa in March, 
          2003, she had already developed advanced symptoms of her disease. Further 
          evaluation confirmed a dismal future without major surgical intervention. 
          Through a great deal of effort, the goodwill of Bolivian professionals, 
          and with funding provided exclusively by my friends and family, Rosa 
          was granted her opportunity for surgical correction on May 7, 2003. 
          To the sadness of everyone involved, she passed away in the final stage 
          of her surgery. She was 11 years old. </span> </p>
        <p align="justify"><span class="txt_body style1 style3"> After all costs of the surgery 
          and the funeral were paid, the funds remaining were utilized for a series 
          of successful medical and social interventions that have provided either 
          lifesaving or life-altering care to other children of Montero. The success 
          of doing so much with so little for the benefit of children spawned 
          the idea of establishing an ongoing fund made up of contributions from 
          a circle of friends and family. In honor of the inspiration this brave 
          little girl provided to all those involved, this collection of money 
          is named &#8220;The Rosa Vera Fund.&#8221; <br>
