                          <p>Just a note to thank you for coming out last weekend to help us celebrate another successful year for the Rosa Vera Fund. &nbsp;With the start of a beautiful fall, it seemed like a great time to reach out to our friends and supporters and say a genuine &quot;Thank You&quot; for your support.</p>
                          <p>Some of the year's highlights are:</p>
                          <ul >
                            <li>Juan is receiving physical therapy to help him recover from brain injuries he received after he tragically fell from a motorcycle taxi.</li>
                            <li>We are 1/2 way to raising the funding needed for a specialized hearing aid implant for 12 year-old Maria Ciela, an orphan who we've been supporting for the past five years.&nbsp;Maria's hearing loss is complicated, but correctable. She is so excited that she is close to gaining the ability to hear!</li>
                            <li>Hugo Nelson made it!&nbsp; A few years ago, Hugo was completely blind due to a condition called trichiasis, which causes the eyelashes to grow inward. After two simple operations totaling less than $250, Hugo's sight was restored, he quickly caught up in school, and applied for one of our educational scholarships to become a mechanic. &nbsp;He graduated, is able to support his siblings, and hopes to open his own shop.&nbsp; With the help of our donors - you guys - Hugo's family is able to break free of crushing poverty.</li>
                          </ul></td>
                      </tr>
                      <tr>

                        <td width="280" colspan="4" style="line-height: 20px; font-size: 13px; color: #2b2c26; font-family: arial, Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;"><p style="margin-bottom:10px;">These are just a few of the amazing things that the RVF worked on this year. &nbsp;If you check out our website (<a href="http://www.rosaverafund.org/">RosaVeraFund.org</a>) you will see the actual faces of the women and children we work with. &nbsp;Many of the children would not be alive today without your support. &nbsp;For that, we thank you! </p>
                          <p style="margin-bottom:10px;">Please consider renewing your support for the RVF this year. &nbsp;We want to reach you before all the other end-of-year requests arrive.&nbsp; The easiest way is to make a donation is online through our website. &nbsp;You can choose to make your donation all at once, or monthly.</p>
                          <p style="margin-bottom:10px;">If you came to help us celebrate, but have not had a chance yet to learn about our work, I hope you will take a few minutes to check it out.</p>
                          <p style="margin-bottom:10px;">Unlike almost any other nonprofit out there, we can honestly say that 100% of our donations are used for the families - not one penny is taken out for administrative expenses. &nbsp;You can be sure that your donation really counts.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
                        <p>Karen</p></td>
