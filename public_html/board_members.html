                <br>
                As the daughter of a political refugee from Cuba, Darlene Ray was able to gain an inside view of the barriers her mother experienced when trying to access services for her family. Not only was it difficult to communicate at times, but the culture was entirely new to her.  Helping the underserved would become Darlene's focus after graduating from the University of Arizona medical school. Knowing that intervening early in children's lives ensures their best chance for a healthy future, Darlene has focused her career on those children with the least access to quality medical care.  She currently works on a mobile medical clinic in southern Arizona and part time in south Florida, both partnerships with the Children's Health Fund.  Working with the Rosa Vera Fund has allowed her to expand her practice of medicine to some of the most disadvantaged children in Latin America. </span></td>
